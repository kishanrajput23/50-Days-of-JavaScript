# Is this a triangle?

## Instructions

- Implement a function that accepts 3 integer values a, b, c. The function should return true if a triangle can be built with the sides of given length and false in any other case.
- (In this case, all triangles must have surface greater than 0 to be accepted).
- Hint You can check whether the sum of the two sides of a triangle is greater than the third side in all possible combinations.

## Challenges (0/2 done)
- [ ] isTriangle(1,2,2) should return true
- [ ] isTriangle(7,2,2) should return false
- [ ] isTriangle(7,14,16) should return true

```js
function isTriangle(a, b, c) {
  // your code here
}
```
