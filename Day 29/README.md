# Mumbling

- Each char becomes n*chars where n is the index + 1, and the first char is capitalized divided by - instead of space
- Only alphabets are passed as arguments for the accum(s) funciton

## Example

- accum("ZpglnRxqenU") should return "Z-Pp-Ggg-Llll-Nnnnn-Rrrrrr-Xxxxxxx-Qqqqqqqq-Eeeeeeeee-Nnnnnnnnnn-Uuuuuuuuuuu"

## Challenges (0/3 done)
- [ ] accum("ZpglnRxqenU") returns "Z-Pp-Ggg-Llll-Nnnnn-Rrrrrr-Xxxxxxx-Qqqqqqqq-Eeeeeeeee-Nnnnnnnnnn-Uuuuuuuuuuu"
- [ ] accum("NyffsGeyylB") returns "N-Yy-Fff-Ffff-Sssss-Gggggg-Eeeeeee-Yyyyyyyy-Yyyyyyyyy-Llllllllll-Bbbbbbbbbbb"
- [ ] accum("MjtkuBovqrU") returns "M-Jj-Ttt-Kkkk-Uuuuu-Bbbbbb-Ooooooo-Vvvvvvvv-Qqqqqqqqq-Rrrrrrrrrr-Uuuuuuuuuuu"

function accum(s) {
  // your code goes below
}
