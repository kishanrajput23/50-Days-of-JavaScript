# Write a Program to Find the Factorial of a Number

## Instruction
- The factorial of a number is the product of all the numbers from 1 to that number. For example,
- factorial of 5 is equal to 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.
- The factorial of a positive number n is given by:
- factorial of n (n!) = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4.....n The factorial of negative numbers do not exist and the factorial of 0 is 1.

## Challenges (0/3 done)
- [ ] factorial(2) is 2
- [ ] factorial(5) is 120
- [ ] factorial(10) is 3628800

```js
function factorial(n) {
	// write your code here
	return
}

let n = 4;
console.log("The factorial of " + n + " is " + factorial(n));
```
