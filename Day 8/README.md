+ The difference between 2 dates in JavaScript will give the time difference in milliseconds
+ Time difference can be converted in to days by dividing the 24Hrs time in milliseconds

- [ ] getDaysBetweenDates('10/15/2020', '12/1/2020') returns 47
- [ ] getDaysBetweenDates('11/10/2021', '11/12/2021') returns 2
- [ ] getDaysBetweenDates('11/01/2020', '11/05/2020') returns 4

```js
const DAY_IN_MILLISECONDS = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;

function getDaysBetweenDates(dateText1, dateText2) {
    // write your solution here

    return
}

console.log(`Days difference: ${getDaysBetweenDates('10/15/2020', '12/1/2020')}`)
