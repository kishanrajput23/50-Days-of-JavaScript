# Rna Transcription

## Instructions
- Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).
- Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.
- The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).
- The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and uracil (U).
- Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:
- G -> C
- C -> G
- T -> A
- A -> U

## Challenges (0/2 done)
- [ ] transcription('GCT') should return 'CGA'
- [ ] transcription('GATC') should return 'CUAG'

```js
const transcription = (dna) => {
	// code here

	return
}
