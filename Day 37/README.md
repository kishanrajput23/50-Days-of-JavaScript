# Tell if its a leap year

## Instructions
- Given a year, report if it is a leap year.
- The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:
- on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 except every year that is evenly divisible by 100 unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
- For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.
- Notes Though our exercise adopts some very simple rules, there is more to learn!
